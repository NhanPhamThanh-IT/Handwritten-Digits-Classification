## What is TensorFlow?

**TensorFlow** is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building, training, and deploying machine learning and deep learning models, from research to production.

- **Website:** [https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

---

## Why Use TensorFlow?

- **Versatile:** Supports deep learning, classical ML, and even reinforcement learning.
- **Scalable:** Runs on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, from desktops to clusters.
- **Production-Ready:** Tools for deployment on web, mobile, and cloud.
- **Community:** Large ecosystem, extensive documentation, and active community.

---

## Installing TensorFlow

Install TensorFlow using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

For GPU support, see the [official guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

---

## Core Concepts

- **Tensors:** Multi-dimensional arrays, the basic data structure in TensorFlow.
- **Graphs & Eager Execution:** TensorFlow 2.x uses eager execution by default, making it more Pythonic and intuitive.
- **Keras API:** High-level API for building and training models.

---

## Building a Simple Model

Hereâ€™s how to build a simple neural network for digit classification:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

---

## Training and Evaluation

Compile and train your model:

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.1)
```

Evaluate on test data:

```python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")
```

---

## Saving and Loading Models

Save your trained model:

```python
model.save('models/model.keras')
```

Load a saved model:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
model = keras.models.load_model('models/model.keras')
```

---

## Using TensorFlow with MNIST

TensorFlow provides direct access to the MNIST dataset:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
```

Preprocess the data as needed (see [mnist-dataset.md](mnist-dataset.md)).

---

## Best Practices

- **Normalize Data:** Always scale input data for better convergence.
- **Monitor Training:** Use callbacks like `EarlyStopping` and `ModelCheckpoint`.
- **Experiment:** Try different architectures, optimizers, and learning rates.
- **Document:** Comment your code and keep track of experiments.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Installation Issues:** Check Python and pip versions, and consult the [official install guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
- **GPU Not Detected:** Ensure correct drivers and CUDA/cuDNN versions.
- **Shape Errors:** Double-check input and output shapes.
- **Performance:** Use batch normalization, dropout, and data augmentation as needed.
